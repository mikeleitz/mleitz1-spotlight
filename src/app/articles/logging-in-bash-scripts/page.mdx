## Overview

I like to write Bash scripts to handle repetitive tasks or tasks that have steps I can't seem to memorize.

As a Java developer, I'm used to having a robust set of libraries and frameworks to help me build applications like logging. Bash scripts don't have most of those luxuries however.

Here's how I implement logging with all my Bash scripts.

## The Code

Copy this code. Save it in a file called ./02-logging.sh. You can then execute the script and see the logging in action.

```bash
#!/usr/bin/env bash

  # Swipe: This is how you can add logging to your bas script. It's easy
  #        to add and the log levels map to syslog.

# Specify all log levels
#
# These numbers and codes correspond to the syslog
# standard: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syslog
#
# If you need to log some problem, typically you would use err or warn
LOG_LEVELS=(
  "0:emerg"
  "1:alert"
  "2:crit"
  "3:err"
  "4:warning"
  "5:notice"
  "6:info"
  "7:debug"
)

# __VERBOSE specifies what level to log while the script runs. By default
# it's 4, which means only warning, err, crit, and alert messages will be
# echoed to standard out.
#
# You can use script inputs to adjust it up or down. If you use something
# like --verbose, you would set __VERBOSE=7 to log all output up to and
# including debug.
# See 10-parse-input.sh on how verbose can be handled as input option.
export __VERBOSE=4

# log function takes in 2 args
#
# arg 1: the level to log output at. It's a number between 0 and 7.
# arg 2: the message you want to log
#
# example:
# .log 3 "This is an error message"
# .log 4 "This is a warning message"
# .log 7 "This is a debug message"
function .log() {
  local LEVEL=${1}
  shift
  if [ "${__VERBOSE}" -ge "${LEVEL}" ]; then
    echo "[${LOG_LEVELS[$LEVEL]#*:}]" "$@"
  fi
}

.log 3 "This is an error message with __VERBOSE=4"
.log 4 "This is a warning message with __VERBOSE=4"
.log 7 "This is a debug message with __VERBOSE=4"

# When you run this script, notice how it doesn't log the debug message.
# Since __VERBOSE=4, it only logs up to warning and won't print notice,
# info, or debug.

# By changing __VERBOSE=7, it will output all log severities

echo
echo "Changing __VERBOSE level to 7."
echo

__VERBOSE=7

.log 3 "This is an error message with __VERBOSE=7"
.log 4 "This is a warning message with __VERBOSE=7"
.log 7 "This is a debug message with __VERBOSE=7"

# Run this snippet

# chmod +x 02-logging.sh
# ./02-logging.sh

# You should see the following output

# [err] This is an error message with __VERBOSE=4
# [warning] This is a warning message with __VERBOSE=4
#
# Changing __VERBOSE level to 7.
#
# [err] This is an error message with __VERBOSE=7
# [warning] This is a warning message with __VERBOSE=7
# [debug] This is a debug message with __VERBOSE=7

# Now you can use logging in all your scripts to help
# troubleshoot problems and let the user know of any
# errors.

```

## Wrap Up

This logging script comes straight out of my Bash Swipe file.
