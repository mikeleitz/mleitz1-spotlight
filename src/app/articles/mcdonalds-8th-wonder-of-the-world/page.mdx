If you went back in time and told someone in 1810 about the future, they wouldn't believe you when you described McDonald's.

Modern day McDonald's is so throughly awesome it would stupefy anyone born before 1900.

I bet people back then can get their heads around cars, airplanes, TV, and even going to the moon. They wouldn't believe you that something as wonderful as McDonald's could exist. Ever.

## Why is McDonald's so great?

One McChicken sandwich at McDonald's, one of my favorites, is 357 calories. It costs one dollar.

A minimum wage job currently pays you $7.25 an hour. After taxes it's somewhere around $6.50 an hour.

For one hour of minimum wage work you can buy 6 McChicken sandwiches. That's a shocking 2,142 calories for a single hour of work.

I couldn't find exactly how many calories the average person ate back in 1810. I certainly could be wrong here, but I doubt it was regularly over 2,000.

Telling them that in the future for one single hour of work they could get a whole day's worth of food, they could very well die laughing.

## The 8th Wonder of the Modern World

McDonald's is so great it should be classified one of the wonders of the world. Yet modern society consistently shits on it.
