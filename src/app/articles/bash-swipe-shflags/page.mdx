## Overview

Professional devs and 10x devs in particular use Bash scripts constantly to improve their productivity.

Yet many devs don't use them? Why? What's stopping devs from reaching the 10x plateau? It's that Bash scripting is too hard.

Bash scripting is an esoteric practice that's more like black magic than a programmer's tool.

I'm going to change that. I'm going to make Bash scripts more approachable to the developer community and you *can* get your head around this technology. You can elevate your game.

## Parsing Bash Inputs

Given how so many Bash scripts accept user input, you would think parsing and validating user input would be easy. It's not. It's stupidly hard.

Luckily someone at Google [Kate Ward](https://github.com/kward) created [shflags](https://github.com/kward/shflags). shflags makes it easy to parse user input.

Here's a script I wrote explaining how to use shflags. Once you see this, you'll never think parsing Bash inputs is hard again.

```bash
#!/usr/bin/env bash

# use shflags. This acts as an import type statement.
. ../deps/shflags/shflags.sh

# shflags is a script that helps parse bash inputs. It's tremendous and handles the tedious parsing of inputs.
# https://github.com/kward/shflags
#
# IMPORTANT FOR OSX
# osx comes with a version of getopt that is very limited. You need to install homebrew gnu-getopt and update your PATH
#
# Here's how (mac osx only)
#
# brew install gnu-getopt
# echo 'export PATH="/opt/homebrew/opt/gnu-getopt/bin:$PATH"' >> ~/.zshrc
# open new terminal tab/window or run: source ~/.zshrc
#

# Example using shflags:
#
# Let's say, a fictitious bash script does some sort of processing.
#
# You might need the following variables input by the user
#
# 1. input-path:string          - where the file is
# 2. ignore-whitespace:boolean  - should the program ignore whitespace
# 3. compression-factor:float   - set the level of compression the user wants
# 4. repeat:integer             - how many times the user wants to repeat the process
#
# A sample execution looks like this
#
# ./12-parse-input-with-shflags.sh --input-path '/my/path' -w -c "0.5" -r 10 my additional input
#
# Typically, in Bash you would have to write all the code to handle this yourself, but shflags makes this all very easy.
#
# We have 4 options: --input-path, --ignore-whitespace, --compression-factor, and --repeat.
#
# --input-path this is a string value we want to default the value to './'
# --ignore-whitespace is a boolean. It defaults to false unless the user specifies --ignore-whitespace. Default false.
# --compression-factor is a float value and defaults to 0.5
# --repeat in an integer that defaults to 1.
#
# Defining variables in shfalgs is easy and it uses the following format
#
# Let's use input-path as an example.
#
# How to define input-path in shflags:
#
# DEFINE_string 'input-path' './' 'input path for the operation' 'i'
#
# What each element of that statement means
#
#  _flags_type_=$1                     # e.g. DEFINE_string, DEFINE_float, DEFINE_integer, DEFINE_boolean
#  _flags_name_=$2                     # the variable. In this case: input-path
#  _flags_default_=$3                  # the default value of './'
#  _flags_help_=${4:-ยง}                # text to display when user inputs -h. NOTE: Special value 'ยง' indicates no help string provided.
#  _flags_short_=${5:-${__FLAGS_NULL}} # the short name. -i in this case.
#
# To Summarize
#
# arg0 - the data type
# arg1 - variable to put input into
# arg2 - default value
# arg3 - help test
# arg4 - short name

### The actual working script ###

# input-path allows the caller to use --input-path <value>. The script puts <value> into the variable FLAGS_input_path.
# the dashes turn to underscores for the variable name.
# ./ is the default value in case the caller doesn't specify the option.
# 'input path for the operation' is what shows up in the help text. ./12-parse-input-with-shflags.sh --help
# i is the short version. e.g. ./12-parse-input-with-shflags.sh -i <value>
DEFINE_string 'input-path' './' 'input path for the operation' 'i'

# float and integer are the same way.
# In addition float and integer will run a validation and make sure the caller uses valid input.
DEFINE_float 'compression-factor' '0.5' 'how much compression to use' 'c'
DEFINE_integer 'repeat' '1' 'how many times to run the operation' 'r'

# Boolean allows true/false switches. If --ignore-whitespace is added, the variable FLAGS_ignore_whitespace will equal 1 (true).
DEFINE_boolean 'ignore-whitespace' '0' 'should the operation ignore whitespace' 'w'

# if the caller tries to use any option that's not specified, they will get an error.

# This call tells the script to do work.
FLAGS "$@" || exit $?
eval set -- "${FLAGS_ARGV}"

# display the results to the console
echo "input path: ${FLAGS_input_path}"
echo "ignore whitespace: ${FLAGS_ignore_whitespace}"
echo "compression factor: ${FLAGS_compression_factor}"
echo "repeat: ${FLAGS_repeat}"

# These are the additional arguments passed in: my additional input
# $1 = my
# $2 = additional
# $3 = input
echo "argument 1: $1"
echo "argument 2: $2"
echo "argument 3: $3"

# Now you try it!
#
# run this example you've been reading:
#
# ./12-parse-input-with-shflags.sh --input-path '/my/path' -w -c "0.5" -r 10 my additional input
#
# expected output
#   input path: /my/path
#   ignore whitespace: 1
#   compression factor: 0.5
#   repeat: 10
#   argument 1: my
#   argument 2: additional
#   argument 3: input
#
# run example:
#
# ./12-parse-input-with-shflags.sh --input-path '/my/path' -c "0.5" -r 10 my additional input
#
#   input path: /my/path
#   ignore whitespace: 0
#   compression factor: 0.5
#   repeat: 10
#   argument 1: my
#   argument 2: additional
#   argument 3: input
#
## This example doesn't have -w. Notice how ignore whitespace is now 0 instead of 1. Everything else is the same.
#
# run example:
#
# ./12-parse-input-with-shflags.sh --input-path '/my/path' -w -c "xyz" -r 10 my additional input
#
# expected output is an error message because -c expects a float number
#   flags:FATAL invalid float value (xyz)
#

#
# That's it!
# Knowing this information will dramatically speed up your bash script creations
#

```

## Conclusion

Part of being a great developer is understanding what tools and technologies are out there and how to use them.

Bash is ubiquitous. Understanding how to use it will help you in your day to day developer life.
