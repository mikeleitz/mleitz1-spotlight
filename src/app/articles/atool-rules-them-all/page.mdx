## Overview

There are many file archive options. Each archive option has their own specialized commands to operate on them: create, list, extract, etc.

Back in 2001, Oskar Liljeblad created one single tool to operate in a consistent manner on all popular archive formats.

It's called atool and it's amazing.

## Archive support

atool supports all major archive and compression schemes including various combinations of tar+zip.


## Standardization

atool standardizes the behavior so no matter what archive you're dealing with its creation and extraction behaves the same way.

Have you ever extracted a tarball and had 1000 files scattered in the current directory? I've done that. Many times. It sucks.

With atool, extracting a .tar archive will automatically put the extracted files into a subdirectory. No more 52 card pickup.

## Tutorial

I'll show you how to

 * create an archive
 * list its contents
 * extract the files
 * change the archive from one format to another.

```bash
mkdir atool-tutorial

cd atool-tutorial

echo 'hello' >> a.txt
echo 'good bye' >> b.txt

# Create a .zip file containing these two files

apack my-archive.zip a.txt b.txt

# Now have file called my-archive.zip
# Look inside the archive using atool's als command

als my-archive.zip

# Double check the file using 'file' command

file my-archive.zip

# my-archive.zip: Zip archive data, at least v1.0 to extract

# Test extract
rm a.txt
rm b.txt

ls

# Only the archive left in the directory

aunpack my-archive.zip

# Creates a subdirectory and extracts files to it

ls -lahrt my-archive

# Remove extracted directory, keeping the zip file

rm -rf my-archive

# Use atool to change the archive from .zip to .tar.gz

arepack my-archive.zip my-archive.tar.gz

ls -lahrt

# New file is .gz

file my-archive.tar.gz

# Demonstrate using gunzip/tar on this new file -- the old way

gunzip my-archive.tar.gz
tar xf my-archive.tar

# Files extracted to current directory, yuck!

ls -lahrt

# Remove the extracted files and tarball
rm a.txt
rm b.txt
rm my-archive.tar

# Try the tar.gz again, but using only atool

arepack my-archive.zip my-archive.tar.gz
aunpack my-archive.tar.gz

ls -lahrt

# Notice how atool didn't extract the tar.gz to current directory.
# atool created a specific subdirectory for it. Nice!

```

## Wrap up

Get out of archive hell.

Stop using narrow commands like tar, gzip, gunzip, zip, bzip, etc. Too much to memorize.

There's even a [tar comic from xkcd](https://xkcd.com/1168/) that highlights how awful the tar commands is.

Up your productivity by using higher level commands like atool.

One command to rule all archives!
